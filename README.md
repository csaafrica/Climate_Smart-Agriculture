## Project 6: Climate-Smart Agriculture Recommender 

**Problem Statement**  
Farmers need guidance on crop selection as climate patterns shift. Build a recommendation system for climate-appropriate crops.

### Data Sources:

- FAO Global Agro-Ecological Zones: Data portal Climate.gov
- historical weather data: NOAA data portal
- Market price data from regional commodity exchanges

### Deliverables:

1. Crop suitability maps under current and projected climate 
2. Recommendation engine for crop selection
3. Profit optimization model including climate risk
4. Farmer decision-support tool prototype Technical report 

### Technical Requirements:

- Implement collaborative filtering for recommendations
- Use Random Forest for suitability classification
- Monte Carlo simulation for risk analysis
- Create interactive Streamlit app
